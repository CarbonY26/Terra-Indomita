#LOBBY RECOMMENDED COUNTRY INTROS
qin_start:0 "#T Qin#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nAs all of China is consumed by the conflagration of the Warring States Period, the state of Qin is slowly but surely beginning to dominate her neighbors. Strengthened by innovative Legalist Reforms and bolstered by an indomitable martial spirit, Qin stands on the precipice of history."
yamato_start:0 "#T Yamato#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nFar to the East lies the island of Wa, which is partitioned and divided between the various tribes that live on its shores. Life can be difficult on Wa; the region of Yamato, a small enclave of farmland surrounded by rolling hills, is home to a sturdy and industrious people that are prepared for anything."

 ##ACB RELIGIONS

 desc_chinese_religions:0 "A land that is as vast as China is contains many philosophies and traditions that are interwoven to create a rich tapestry of spiritual life; the precepts of the great teachers, such as Kong Fuzi, are respected and upheld alongside the ancient ritual practices of the local clans. Ancestors are venerated, and sacred gifts are offered to the capricious guardian spirits that protect the hearth."
 hu_religions:0 "Hu"
 desc_hu_religions:0 "Life on the Great Steppes can be harsh, and the religion of its peoples is focused on the practicalities of everyday life, eschewing metaphysical mysteries for the realities that can be seen and observed; the Sun, Moon, Heaven, and our honorable Ancestors are worthy of veneration."
 baiyue_religions:0 "Baiyue"
 desc_baiyue_religions:0 "The religious teachings of the Baiyue reveal that everything in the world around us, from the mighty streams that flow from the mountains into the marshes to the rocks and stones that comprise the riverbank, has a soul and is worthy of worship, so that the universe might remain in a harmonious state."
 yi_religions:0 "Yi"
 desc_yi_religions:0 "The religious practices of the Yi are similar to those around them, yet there are distinctive markers that distinguish the tenets of the Yi from those of their neighbors. The veneration of dragons, who alone have the authority to ensure the harvests and protect our villages from illness and misfortune, is supremely important."
 wa_religions:0 "Wa"
 desc_wa_religions:0 "The spirits worshiped by the Wa are a direct reflection of the violent world they inhabit; ruled by an Animist pantheon of squabbling demons and gods that can only have their thirst quenched by the blood of worthy sacrifices, the Wa remember the ancient ways amd uphold them faithfully."

#AOS GOVERNMENTS
chinese_empire:0 "Chinese Empire"
chinese_empire_desc:0 "As shown by the reigns of the Shang and Zhou Dynasties, in which the divine authority of the Emperor was demonstrated for all under Heaven to see, the Imperial Form of government remains the supreme achievement of political life, all but ensuring peace and prosperity for conscientious stewards of the Mandate of Heaven."

enfeoffment_zhourites:0 "Enfeoffment Zhourites"
enfeoffment_zhourites_desc:0 "The system of governance created by our predecessors in the Shang Dynasty remains a viable way of ruling the people to this very day. By creating a vast, decentralized bureaucratic state, in which lands and authority are meted out to powerful vassals in return for oaths of submission, true peace can be secured."

chinese_duhufu:0 "Duhufu"
chinese_duhufu_desc:0 "In order to properly adminster the hinterlands, special types of administrative districts known as 'Duhufu' are established as ways to entrench the Imperial power in the lands that are distant from our capital. The governor of a Duhufu has unquestioned military and economic authority, carrying out the commands of their superiors with one voice."

#ACB HERITAGES (TI HERITAGES)

qin_heritage:0 "Qin Heritage"
qin_heritage_desc:0 "The Qin excel at organization, with an affinity for reform that has quickly propelled these people to lofty heights involving military and legal matters. Their fearsome armies are disciplined and faithful, the veterans of many successful campaigns, although their inexperience at sea leaves something to be desired - a rare weakness that their many foes hope to exploit."

qi_heritage:0 "Qi Heritage"
qi_heritage_desc:0 "The Qi are a bundle of contradictions to those unfamiliar with their ways; seemingly disorganized, yet inhabiting cities built to exacting standards, blessed with material wealth yet cursed with an uncaring aristocracy that is disinterested in ruling...\nDespite these surface flaws, the Qi respond rapidly to external threats, abandoning the pretense of chaos in favor of a unified response."

zhao_heritage:0 "Zhao Heritage"
zhao_heritage_desc:0 "Zhao was created in the aftermath of the Partition of Jin, and considering the social upheavals that followed this momentous event, the people of Zhao had to quickly adapt to the new realities presented to them - a task at which they have excelled. Although they struggle to build up the areas they have conquered, their armies are feared for the speed in which they move; a skill the Zhao have honed, due to the constant threats of enemy raids."

chu_heritage:0 "Chu Heritage"
chu_heritage_desc:0 "The Yellow River Basin has given birth to many exceptional cultures, and the Chu are predominant among them. The Chu retain some of their primordial connections to the gods, being blessed with highly gifted shamans, and their music is known for its philosophical musings, revealing the intellectual curiosity that is a hallmark of this people."

yue_heritage:0 "Yue Heritage"
yue_heritage_desc:0 "The Yue people are respected for many things, including their tradition of metalworking, which has no equal among their peers. Hailed as exceptional seamen, the Yue dominate the seas around them, with a naval tradition that is predicated upon centuries of experience plying the waterways."

wei_heritage:0 "Wei Heritage"
wei_heritage_desc:0 "The Partition of Jin resulted in the people of Wei being given their own lands to administer, thanks to the military victories secured by the great general Wen. The Wei are known for their speed in all things; their armies travel faster than others, and their cities sprout like mushrooms, although, in their haste to build permanent structures, their infrastructure is not erected as thoroughly as others."

wei4_heritage:0 "Wei4 Heritage"
wei4_heritage_desc:0 "The Partition of Jin resulted in the people of Wei being given their own lands to administer, thanks to the military victories secured by the great general Wen. Over time, the Wei4 developed slight variances that distinguish their culture from their cousins the Wei, with an emphasis on intellectual pursuits replacing the focus on martial achievements. While this has promoted an advanced society, the army is not as capable in the field as it could be."

song_heritage:0 "Song Heritage"
song_heritage_desc:0 "The history of the Song is filled with conflicts with their neighbors, yet the might of this people has not been extinguished by the desires of their enemies. The Song have a well-established mercantile tradition, with their cities being hailed as pinnacles of civilization; these benefits come at a cost, however, for their people are more loyal to the state than they are to any particular leader."

lu_heritage:0 "Lu Heritage"
lu_heritage_desc:0 "The Lu are surrounded by enemies that openly covet their lands, so it should come as no surprise that the people of Lu have developed a society that is able to forcefully respond to the provocations of their neighbors. Despite these ever-present threats, the Lu are a famously cheerful people, making their civilization an attractive one. Relying on themselves for all things, the Lu distrust distant authority figures, including their own rulers."

han_heritage:0 "Han Heritage"
han_heritage_desc:0 "The Han people traditionally hail from a mountainous region that is difficult for armies to traverse through, and this accident of nature has been embraced by the inhabitants, who have incorporated these defenses into their military doctrines. Their nimble-footed archers train in the rocky defiles and craggy valleys of their homeland, raining devastation upon their foes before they are seen, and disappear into the badlands just as quickly."

yan_heritage:0 "Yan Heritage"
yan_heritage_desc:0 "Nestled between the wild Steppe kingdoms to the North and the settled civilizations of the South, the Yan find themselves with one foot firmly planted in both camps; seeing the value in maintaining a strong network of fortifications, a trick they learned from their civilized neighbors, the Yan also emphasize a powerful cavalry, no doubt due to their frequent skirmishes with the barbarian hordes."

zhou_heritage:0 "Zhou Heritage"
zhou_heritage_desc:0 "To be a part of the Zhou is to partake of an honor with practically no equal, for it was the Zhou that laid low the power of the Shang, establishing an illustrious Dynasty that survives into present times. Although the military hegemony of the Zhou is a shadow of what it once was, being forced by circumstance to rely on the vassalship of ambitious warlords, it would be premature to claim that the glory days of the Zhou are gone forever."

goguryeo_heritage:0 "Goguryeo Heritage"
goguryeo_heritage_desc:0 "The Goguryeo made the decision long ago to eschew the trappings of the civilized world, preferring to trust in their daunting fortifications and archer's bowstrings rather than relying on the pampered musings of a philosopher's treatise to guide their people. They are rumored to be the best bowmen the world has ever seen, never allowing their enemies the chance to test the strength of their city walls."

baekje_heritage:0 "Baekje Heritage"
baekje_heritage_desc:0 "The Baekje tribes settled in their homelands long ago, moving away from the coasts while making a concerted effort to maintain the naval traditions that had served their ancestors so well. While their military infrastructure is not as strong as it could be, the Baekje more than make up for this perceived shortcoming with their increased economic activities."

saro_heritage:0 "Saro Heritage"
saro_heritage_desc:0 "The Saro are an erudite people, who have seen firsthand what the application of wisdom can do for one's society; as such, there is an emphasis on academic traditions that make the Saro civilization exceptional, although there are some that argue that the atmosphere of intellectual permissiveness has damaged loyalty to the state."

guya_heritage:0 "Guya Heritage"
guya_heritage_desc:0 "At some point in their history, the Guya made a fateful decision that has had important ramifications for their culture; by purposefully choosing to lower the taxes on their people, the Guya have created conditions that allow trade to flourish in their capital, which is guarded and protected by armies with an unusually high morale."

yamato_heritage:0 "Yamato Heritage"
yamato_heritage_desc:0 "The people of Yamato are natural leaders, blessed with a large and fruitful populace, and are known and respected for their religious traditions, which they faithfully execute with the utmost piety. When compared to their neighbors, their relative isolation has hurt their diplomatic reputation; they are rumored to be untrusting of strangers."

chinese_heritage:0 "Chinese Heritage"
chinese_heritage_desc:0 "Although the tax receipts are not as healthy as those compared to the surrounding people, those with a Chinese heritage are gifted with a growing populace and an exceptional diplomatic corps, able to improve a neighbor's opinions with an ease that is the envy of less distinguished courts."

loulan_heritage:0 "Loulan Heritage"
loulan_heritage_desc:0 "Sitting at the edge of the Lop Desert, which joins the Tarim Basin, it sat at the beginning of the Northern Route which would become one of the main threads of the Silk Road. The quick-growing and cosmopolitan cities of the Loulan Kingdom allowed for it to control much of the trade in the area and to expand, encompassing rival cities in order to negate neighborly competition. It sits poised to control much of the Tarim Basin with its growing power."

### Southeast Asian TI Heritages
# Pegu
pegu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Sea Pyu"
pegu_heritage_desc:0 "Downstream from Sri Ksetra, there is a legend of a place called 'Pinle Pyu' which was adjacent to the sea. Large in size, the settlements around the seaside contain records of Brahmi script. It is still uncertain whether this site was the upstream location of Ingapu or somewhere more southern, perhaps closer to the settlement of Pegu which was a Mon-culture stronghold. Artifacts from the area date to the Paleolithic period at the earliest."
# Thaton
thaton_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Theravadan Hall of the Gods"
thaton_heritage_desc:0 "While the stories claim that Thaton was a product of the age of the Buddha, built during the life of the holy man, it is more firmly understood that the kingdom of Thaton existed from at least the 4th century BCE. Trading heavily with India and Sri Lanka, many Buddhist people flocked here and set up the foundation for the Theravada school of Buddhism. Much of this can be attributed to the work of Moggaliputta-Tissa, the monk responsible for many overseas missions. Thaton thus, in stories, derived its name from Suvarnabhumi, meaning 'assembly of the gods.' Thus this holy place served as a basis for continuous Buddhist spread thereafter."
# Yilumo
yilumo_heritage:0 "Heritage of Yilumo"
yilumo_heritage_desc:0 "One of the city-state the Chinese would pass or stop at on their way to Indian markets, Yilumo was one of the early Mon settlements on the coast of the Bay of Bengal. While the northern Indian territories promised Chinese merchants pearls and opaque glass, coastal site such as Yilumo provided some of the harder trade goods, like raw lumber and other natural necessities that assisted in facilitating the trade route."
# Tenasserim
tenasserim_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Sea Gypsies"
tenasserim_heritage_desc:0 "The archipelago which surrounds the coast of the Tenasserim region is home to a vast array of life, from whales and Irrawaddy dolphins to whale sharks and dugongs. Such a wildlife diversity in the bay and among the mangrove forests which cross the waters allowed for the people to lean heavily on a fishing lifestyle. However, the islands also lent themselves to Chinese and other merchants and sailors as hideouts and alternative pathways to the open waters which were subject to monsoons and other dangers. The coast thus brought riches to the coastal settlements which had their own goods to trade as well. Ancient Tavoy was loaded with tungsten, tin, and other useful metals that could be traded to more centralized city-building civilizations."
# Khao Sam Kaeo
khao_sam_kaeo_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Port of Ideas"
khao_sam_kaeo_heritage_desc:0 "An important gateway in the Maritime Silk Road, the site of Khao Sam Kaeo came to be by at least the 4th century BCE. Chinese, Philippine, Taiwanese, and other types of goods crossed through their waters and territory in order to access the Indian markets to the west. However, many craftsmen and traders also stayed in the port-city and turned it into a bustling hub of knowledge and production, much more than just a waystation. The silks that were exchanged in its markets appeared as often as new peoples and ideas, leading to a great mixture of technological influences and progress. The local material culture shows such a mixture of peoples in its many unique art styles and products such as stone adzes and jewelry."
# Khuan Lukpad
khuan_lukpad_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Malay Processing Center"
khuan_lukpad_heritage_desc:0 "This site served as a trading post which imported and Indian raw materials and produced finished goods for eastern markets - such is known from their many ring molds (likely meant to be used with gold) and seal molds. From India, they also received goods as far aways as Middle Eastern markets of Persia. Brahmi inscriptions and some Tamil artifacts indicate a possibility of Indian craftsmen also setting up shop in the port in order to be closer to Chinese and other eastern merchants on their way around the Malay peninsula."
# Panpan
panpan_heritage:0 "Heritage of Red Earth Land"
panpan_heritage_desc:0 "While not a major hub in the region, the kingdom of Panpan succeeded in growing a lively trading economy that interacted with the Chinese and other East Asian markets to its north. Strangely enough, their contact with Indian markets to the west actually led to a significant and growing Hindu population which colored the daily life of an otherwise Austronesian populace, influencing local wares and practices in the area. They were known by Chinese sources possibly as the 'Red Earth Land,' perhaps on account of their local soil/clay/pottery or other goods with a penchant for red coloration."
# Kedah
kedah_heritage:0 "Heritage of Ancient Ocean-Lords"
kedah_heritage_desc:0 "Established in the early 8th century BCE, the kingdom of Kedah and the settlement of Sungai Batu were older than Rome itself and were set up for major success in naval trade from the beginning. Iron was accessible, and their position in the Malay peninsula, both close to the Strait of Malacca and on the same latitude line as Ceylon (Sri Lanka) allowed ships to most easily sail directly to and access Ceylon and South Indian markets by leaving from their port as opposed to any others. However, they were not simply a trading station for others to pass through, and built their own fleet of Austronesian/Malay ships to bring their native goods westward. Reports tell of them having light vessels for local transportation and traffic, larger vessels for major transfers of goods, and great ocean-going vessels which took their own sailors directly to Indian, Sumatran, and Bangli ports and markets. They held a powerful command over the ocean and the ability to sail it."
# Langkashuka
langkashuka_heritage:0 "Heritage of Merong the 'Alexandrian'"
langkashuka_heritage_desc:0 "One of the older successful seaports on the Golden Chersonese (Malay Peninsula), the Kingdom of Langkashuka and the settlement of Pattani were only a bit younger than Old Kedah. It was supposedly founded by a king named Merong Mahawangsa, who supposedly traveled and learned from many great Empires both east and west, and even fought a great phoenix called the Garuda on his naval travels. Some stories claim he was a descendant or relative of Alexander the Great, but most of all his tales and aspects bleed of legend and superstition. What the reality of this founder may, however, betray, was the reality that many Indian travelers, traders, and Buddhist missionaries arrived at the port of Pattani and became integral components of the kingdom, altering its populace’s identity and faith."
# Kelantan
kelantan_heritage:0 "Heritage of Malaysian Ghosts"
kelantan_heritage_desc:0 "The history and foundation of Kelantan are shrouded in myth - the land is said to have once been walked by giants (To' Gedambai), with a great Naga coming onto the shore with the push of a flood. A Tiger roamed the forest, the Hantu Belian, stalking its prey, and the aboriginals (To' Bomor), hid in the crevices, tiny black youths which some consider to have been the ghosts of the dead. Other tales claim the city was founded by a queen of the Sakai named Gunong Ayam. With a largely agrarian economy/society and some of the largest mountains in the Malay peninsula to separate it from other areas, the land of Kelantan is full of mystery and secrets."
# Gangga Negara
gangga_negara_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Far Ganges"
gangga_negara_heritage_desc:0 "Gangga Negara, meaning 'city on the Ganges,' takes its name from the Northwestern Indian Kambuja traders and merchants that settled the area along with many others in the Malay peninsula. In contrast, the settlement of Beruas takes its name from the local Beruas tree and fruit. Some stories tell how the kingdom was founded by Raja Ganji Sarjuna of Old Kedah, a nearby neighboring and older kingdom. Like other traveling kings, this man was supposedly a descendant of Alexander the Great. The Indian settlement, however, did introduce Hinduism to the Malay natives to create a vibrant cultural and religious mixture when considering their art and cult sites."
# Selangor
selangor_heritage:0 "Heritage of a Bronze Klang"
selangor_heritage_desc:0 "With its most important city of Klang having been inhabited since the early Bronze Age, the territory of Selangor has long been a player in Malaysian geo-politics. The city of Klang itself fueled the power of Selangor with a tin-rich valley and the ability to make quality bronzes. Their metalworkers could fashion such wonderful objects as the Klang-type bell, iron tools called 'ape-bones,' and bronze drums meant either for war or ritual festivities. Connected by tich waterways to the sea, it could transport these metal luxuries and necessities to trading partners all over."
# Pahang
pahang_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Mahang Tree"
pahang_heritage_desc:0 "Taking both its name and border from the Pahang river, which itself supposedly received its name from a legendary mahang tree that stretched across the river with its roots, settlements within the kingdom of Pahang have existed since the mesolithic period. Bronze, especially in the form of war-drums, became prominent by 400 BCE, and goldworking became a mainstay in production and trade, helping to give the Malay peninsula its known title of the 'Golden Chersonese.' However, while the area was a cradle of Malay culture and civilization, it often found itself subordinate to Funan-area kingdoms and influenced by those far-off courts."
# Kota Gelanggi
kota_gelanggi_heritage:0 "Heritage of Malaccan Treasures"
kota_gelanggi_heritage_desc:0 "Possibly known to Mediterranean cultures as Sabana/Sabara, or the port of Nominon Emporium, Kota Gelanggi and the modern-Singapore area were a pivotal point in the Maritime Silk Road, controlling the Strait of Malacca. The settlement of Kota Gelanggi itself was quite rich in its surrounding natural resources and the profits of its trade - a fort or palace made all out of black stone and a name derived from something akin to 'Treasury of Jewels.' It is no surprise that this was therefore a wealthy and prosperous site, gaining the awe and jealousy of its neighbors."
