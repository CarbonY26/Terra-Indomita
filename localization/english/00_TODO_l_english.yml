#LOBBY RECOMMENDED COUNTRY INTROS
qin_start:0 "#T Qin#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nAs all of China is consumed by the conflagration of the Warring States Period, the state of Qin is slowly but surely beginning to dominate her neighbors. Strengthened by innovative Legalist Reforms and bolstered by an indomitable martial spirit, Qin stands on the precipice of history."
yamato_start:0 "#T Yamato#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nFar to the East lies the island of Wa, which is partitioned and divided between the various tribes that live on its shores. Life can be difficult on Wa; the region of Yamato, a small enclave of farmland surrounded by rolling hills, is home to a sturdy and industrious people that are prepared for anything."

 ##ACB RELIGIONS
 chinese_religions:0 "Chinese"
 desc_chinese_religions:0 "A land that is as vast as China is contains many philosophies and traditions that are interwoven to create a rich tapestry of spiritual life; the precepts of the great teachers, such as Kong Fuzi, are respected and upheld alongside the ancient ritual practices of the local clans. Ancestors are venerated, and sacred gifts are offered to the capricious guardian spirits that protect the hearth."
 hu_religions:0 "Hu"
 desc_hu_religions:0 "Life on the Great Steppes can be harsh, and the religion of its peoples is focused on the practicalities of everyday life, eschewing metaphysical mysteries for the realities that can be seen and observed; the Sun, Moon, Heaven, and our honorable Ancestors are worthy of veneration."
 baiyue_religions:0 "Baiyue"
 desc_baiyue_religions:0 "The religious teachings of the Baiyue reveal that everything in the world around us, from the mighty streams that flow from the mountains into the marshes to the rocks and stones that comprise the riverbank, has a soul and is worthy of worship, so that the universe might remain in a harmonious state."
 yi_religions:0 "Yi"
 desc_yi_religions:0 "The religious practices of the Yi are similar to those around them, yet there are distinctive markers that distinguish the tenets of the Yi from those of their neighbors. The veneration of dragons, who alone have the authority to ensure the harvests and protect our villages from illness and misfortune, is supremely important."
 wa_religions:0 "Wa"
 desc_wa_religions:0 "The spirits worshiped by the Wa are a direct reflection of the violent world they inhabit; ruled by an Animist pantheon of squabbling demons and gods that can only have their thirst quenched by the blood of worthy sacrifices, the Wa remember the ancient ways amd uphold them faithfully."

#AOS GOVERNMENTS
chinese_empire:0 "Chinese Empire"
chinese_empire_desc:0 "As shown by the reigns of the Shang and Zhou Dynasties, in which the divine authority of the Emperor was demonstrated for all under Heaven to see, the Imperial Form of government remains the supreme achievement of political life, all but ensuring peace and prosperity for conscientious stewards of the Mandate of Heaven."

enfeoffment_zhourites:0 "Enfeoffment Zhourites"
enfeoffment_zhourites_desc:0 "The system of governance created by our predecessors in the Shang Dynasty remains a viable way of ruling the people to this very day. By creating a vast, decentralized bureaucratic state, in which lands and authority are meted out to powerful vassals in return for oaths of submission, true peace can be secured."

chinese_duhufu:0 "Duhufu"
chinese_duhufu_desc:0 "In order to properly adminster the hinterlands, special types of administrative districts known as 'Duhufu' are established as ways to entrench the Imperial power in the lands that are distant from our capital. The governor of a Duhufu has unquestioned military and economic authority, carrying out the commands of their superiors with one voice."

#ACB HERITAGES

qin_heritage:0 "Qin Heritage"
qin_heritage_desc:0 "The Qin excel at organization, with an affinity for reform that has quickly propelled these people to lofty heights involving military and legal matters. Their fearsome armies are disciplined and faithful, the veterans of many successful campaigns, although their inexperience at sea leaves something to be desired - a rare weakness that their many foes hope to exploit."

qi_heritage:0 "Qi Heritage"
qi_heritage_desc:0 "The Qi are a bundle of contradictions to those unfamiliar with their ways; seemingly disorganized, yet inhabiting cities built to exacting standards, blessed with material wealth yet cursed with an uncaring aristocracy that is disinterested in ruling...\nDespite these surface flaws, the Qi respond rapidly to external threats, abandoning the pretense of chaos in favor of a unified response."

zhao_heritage:0 "Zhao Heritage"
zhao_heritage_desc:0 "Zhao was created in the aftermath of the Partition of Jin, and considering the social upheavals that followed this momentous event, the people of Zhao had to quickly adapt to the new realities presented to them - a task at which they have excelled. Although they struggle to build up the areas they have conquered, their armies are feared for the speed in which they move; a skill the Zhao have honed, due to the constant threats of enemy raids."

chu_heritage:0 "Chu Heritage"
chu_heritage_desc:0 "The Yellow River Basin has given birth to many exceptional cultures, and the Chu are predominant among them. The Chu retain some of their primordial connections to the gods, being blessed with highly gifted shamans, and their music is known for its philosophical musings, revealing the intellectual curiosity that is a hallmark of this people."

yue_heritage:0 "Yue Heritage"
yue_heritage_desc:0 "The Yue people are respected for many things, including their tradition of metalworking, which has no equal among their peers. Hailed as exceptional seamen, the Yue dominate the seas around them, with a naval tradition that is predicated upon centuries of experience plying the waterways."

wei_heritage:0 "Wei Heritage"
wei_heritage_desc:0 "The Partition of Jin resulted in the people of Wei being given their own lands to administer, thanks to the military victories secured by the great general Wen. The Wei are known for their speed in all things; their armies travel faster than others, and their cities sprout like mushrooms, although, in their haste to build permanent structures, their infrastructure is not erected as thoroughly as others."

wei4_heritage:0 "Wei4 Heritage"
wei4_heritage_desc:0 "The Partition of Jin resulted in the people of Wei being given their own lands to administer, thanks to the military victories secured by the great general Wen. Over time, the Wei4 developed slight variances that distinguish their culture from their cousins the Wei, with an emphasis on intellectual pursuits replacing the focus on martial achievements. While this has promoted an advanced society, the army is not as capable in the field as it could be."

song_heritage:0 "Song Heritage"
song_heritage_desc:0 "The history of the Song is filled with conflicts with their neighbors, yet the might of this people has not been extinguished by the desires of their enemies. The Song have a well-established mercantile tradition, with their cities being hailed as pinnacles of civilization; these benefits come at a cost, however, for their people are more loyal to the state than they are to any particular leader."

lu_heritage:0 "Lu Heritage"
lu_heritage_desc:0 "The Lu are surrounded by enemies that openly covet their lands, so it should come as no surprise that the people of Lu have developed a society that is able to forcefully respond to the provocations of their neighbors. Despite these ever-present threats, the Lu are a famously cheerful people, making their civilization an attractive one. Relying on themselves for all things, the Lu distrust distant authority figures, including their own rulers."

han_heritage:0 "Han Heritage"
han_heritage_desc:0 "The Han people traditionally hail from a mountainous region that is difficult for armies to traverse through, and this accident of nature has been embraced by the inhabitants, who have incorporated these defenses into their military doctrines. Their nimble-footed archers train in the rocky defiles and craggy valleys of their homeland, raining devastation upon their foes before they are seen, and disappear into the badlands just as quickly."

yan_heritage:0 "Yan Heritage"
yan_heritage_desc:0 "Nestled between the wild Steppe kingdoms to the North and the settled civilizations of the South, the Yan find themselves with one foot firmly planted in both camps; seeing the value in maintaining a strong network of fortifications, a trick they learned from their civilized neighbors, the Yan also emphasize a powerful cavalry, no doubt due to their frequent skirmishes with the barbarian hordes."

zhou_heritage:0 "Zhou Heritage"
zhou_heritage_desc:0 "To be a part of the Zhou is to partake of an honor with practically no equal, for it was the Zhou that laid low the power of the Shang, establishing an illustrious Dynasty that survives into present times. Although the military hegemony of the Zhou is a shadow of what it once was, being forced by circumstance to rely on the vassalship of ambitious warlords, it would be premature to claim that the glory days of the Zhou are gone forever."

goguryeo_heritage:0 "Goguryeo Heritage"
goguryeo_heritage_desc:0 "The Goguryeo made the decision long ago to eschew the trappings of the civilized world, preferring to trust in their daunting fortifications and archer's bowstrings rather than relying on the pampered musings of a philosopher's treatise to guide their people. They are rumored to be the best bowmen the world has ever seen, never allowing their enemies the chance to test the strength of their city walls."

baekje_heritage:0 "Baekje Heritage"
baekje_heritage_desc:0 "The Baekje tribes settled in their homelands long ago, moving away from the coasts while making a concerted effort to maintain the naval traditions that had served their ancestors so well. While their military infrastructure is not as strong as it could be, the Baekje more than make up for this perceived shortcoming with their increased economic activities."

saro_heritage:0 "Saro Heritage"
saro_heritage_desc:0 "The Saro are an erudite people, who have seen firsthand what the application of wisdom can do for one's society; as such, there is an emphasis on academic traditions that make the Saro civilization exceptional, although there are some that argue that the atmosphere of intellectual permissiveness has damaged loyalty to the state."

guya_heritage:0 "Guya Heritage"
guya_heritage_desc:0 "At some point in their history, the Guya made a fateful decision that has had important ramifications for their culture; by purposefully choosing to lower the taxes on their people, the Guya have created conditions that allow trade to flourish in their capital, which is guarded and protected by armies with an unusually high morale."

yamato_heritage:0 "Yamato Heritage"
yamato_heritage_desc:0 "The people of Yamato are natural leaders, blessed with a large and fruitful populace, and are known and respected for their religious traditions, which they faithfully execute with the utmost piety. When compared to their neighbors, their relative isolation has hurt their diplomatic reputation; they are rumored to be untrusting of strangers."

chinese_heritage:0 "Chinese Heritage"
chinese_heritage_desc:0 "Although the tax receipts are not as healthy as those compared to the surrounding people, those with a Chinese heritage are gifted with a growing populace and an exceptional diplomatic corps, able to improve a neighbor's opinions with an ease that is the envy of less distinguished courts."
