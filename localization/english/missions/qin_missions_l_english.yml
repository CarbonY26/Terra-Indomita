#Missions

qin_01_shan_yang_task_1: "Abrogate Fengjian"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_1_DESC: "The Fengjian feudal system has been the bedrock of Zhou dynasty governance for hundreds of years. However, this decentralized governing form flies in the face of Shang Yang's legalist reforms, which call for increased centralization. We should continue reforming away from feudal obligations as Shang Yang guided us to. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil20!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_2: "Claim Yiqu"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_2_DESC: "We have a long history of fighting with the Rong that live in the territory claimed by the Yiqu, and because of this, it would be a trivial thing for us to claim the lands of the $anding_area$ and $tianshui_area$ region. We have every right to avenge our ancestors! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil23!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_3: "Neuter Yiqu"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_3_DESC: "We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past, and now that we have the Yiqu firmly in hand, we must suppress their culture and encourage their people to embrace ours. As any farmhand can tell you, a stallion that has been neutered is a much less dangerous one. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil18!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_4: "Women's Militias"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_4_DESC: "The women in our cities are more than capable of guarding the city walls while the men fight in the field. Send word to the villages - they shall form militias to protect the home front. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil13!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_5: "Sechuan Assimilation"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_5_DESC: "Located in a strategic area on the periphery of our homeland, the Sechuan Basin is an incredibly important region that we would like to see developed, but we must first win over the people if we are to see our plans take root. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_6: "Curtail Aristocracy"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_6_DESC: "The growing powers of the aristocracy are an ever-present danger, and if we are not careful, we might discover that our greatest enemies are actually those claiming to be our fast friends...we must do something. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil9!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_7: "Civilize Sechuan"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_7_DESC: "Now that the locals have embraced our presence among them, they are amenable to the suggestions that we have regarding improving the local infrastructure. In time, this region will be as civilized as our own. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic11!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_8: "Meritocratic Promotion"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_8_DESC: "One of our greatest strengths is our willingness to promote skilled workers, regardless of the circumstances of their birth; we much prefer a system of meritocracy to the corrupt world of hereditary positions, where bribes are a way of life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_9: "Absolute Authority"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_9_DESC: "Slowly, by degrees, we have consolidated our authority and limited the power of any dissenting voices that are left. Our firm hand now holds the reins of state, and our peerless example leads the nation forward. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_10: "End of the Rong"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_10_DESC: "No more shall the presence of the Rong, our old foes, be found among our peoples - let their memories be extinguished forever, a swirling mote of dust lost in the sands of time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil3!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_11: "Shang Yang's Legacy"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_11_DESC: "Although he is not around to observe the culmination of his vision, we rest secure in our total victory, knowing that Shang Yang would be pleased to see what we have accomplished with our reforms. All members of society, from the lowly plowman to the haughty bureacrat, have had their lives changed for the better. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic8!"

For as long as any can remember, we have clashed with the Yiqu, and this year will be no different than the others.\n\nHowever, one thing is certain; by the time our forces are finished fighting, there will not be two stones standing atop each other - we shall not settle for anything less than their complete annihilation."
me_qin_shan_yang_2.a: "Farewell, ancient foes...give the gods of the underworld our greetings"

me_qin_shan_yang_3_title: "$qin_01_shan_yang_task_3$"
me_qin_shan_yang_3_desc: "Now that the bows of the [GetProvince('(int32)8279').GetName] have been broken, we have nothing to fear from the horselords - no more shall their arrows darken the sky as they charge against our formations, and their swift steeds shall not carry them into on raids into the fields of helpless farmers.\n\nAlthough there will be a period of tension between our peoples as they merge, we will do everything we can to assuage the growing pains."
me_qin_shan_yang_3.a: "The newly-conquered will find the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetCulture.GetName] to be kind masters"

me_qin_shan_yang_4_title: "$qin_01_shan_yang_task_4$"
me_qin_shan_yang_4_desc: "When foreigners sometimes hear that militias of women guard [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetCulture.GetName] cities, they sometimes smirk and make bawdy jokes - but this is before they see how disciplined and deadly serious our female soldiers are.\n\nWhile the men are off busy fighting at the front, they don't have to spare a thought for home, because they are fully confident in the abilities of their wives and mothers to protect the children. This peace of mind is priceless, and we are thankful that our entire country is willing to do their part to help the war effort."
me_qin_shan_yang_4.a: "You second-guess our militias at your own peril, barbarian"
me_qin_shan_yang_4_tooltip: "The mission task '#Y $qin_01_shan_yang_task_4$#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

me_qin_shan_yang_5_title: "$qin_01_shan_yang_task_5$"
me_qin_shan_yang_5_desc: "The lands to our south are filled with disparate peoples, where different faiths and tongues blend together; this is just a fact of life. As too much spice can ruin a fragrant dish, so too can a variety of beliefs and cultures weaken the integrity of a state.\n\nLet us reach out to the Sechuan and encourage them to adopt proper [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetCulture.GetName] traditions - harmonious co-existence is what we aim to bring."

me_qin_shan_yang_6_title: "$qin_01_shan_yang_task_6$"
me_qin_shan_yang_6_desc: "Although the noble classes can be powerful allies, empowering them has its own set of problems as well, and the prudent ruler will keep an eye on their own power. Do not our own histories remind us of the mistakes of our ancestors? In the Annals of the Zhou, time and time again, examples spring forth from the page; the Rebellion of the Three Guards, the Compatriots Rebellion...all of these were led by dissatisfied royalty.\n\nWith these grim examples in mind, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has vowed that [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] will not tread down the well-beaten path."
me_qin_shan_yang_6.a: "We will not make the mistakes the Zhou did"

me_qin_shan_yang_7_desc: "Although some of our advisors darkly joke that the Sechuan are too thick to properly civilize, the efforts undertaken by [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] have proven to all of the naysayers that anything the people of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetCulture.GetName] desire can be accomplished.\n\nAs our civilization finds its roots in new soil, all are praising the foresight of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] for making such wise investments."

me_qin_shan_yang_8_title: "$qin_01_shan_yang_task_8$"
me_qin_shan_yang_8_desc: "One of the byproducts of Zhou rule was the unchecked corruption that swept through the land, leading to a time when weak men caused great misery for the people that they were supposed to protect.\n\nDesiring to see the burdens of the commoners eased, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has bravely declared a silent war against [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] administration, repealing the inherited privileges of the nobility and replacing sycophants with men of virtue. No longer will governors prey on their citizens, but upright leaders will uphold the authority entrusted to them with honor."

[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamily.GetName]. [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], our incomparable leader whose name is already immortal, has brought our country to the greatest heights it has even seen, and there is still much more that [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] aims to accomplish during [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] tenure."

Yet [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has sight beyond sight, able to discern the wisest course when all others are lost, and [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] commanded that [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetCulture.GetName] tackle the reforms with a youthful vigor.\n\nNow, in our hour of triumph, everyone has forgotten the unassuming Minister that set our country on its path with destiny...all, that is, except for [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]."
