  ##ACB RELIGIONS
 chinese_religions:0 "Shenic"
 desc_chinese_religions:0 "A land that is as vast as China is contains many philosophies and traditions that are interwoven to create a rich tapestry of spiritual life; the precepts of the great teachers, such as Kong Fuzi, are respected and upheld alongside the ancient ritual practices of the local clans. Ancestors are venerated, and sacred gifts are offered to the capricious guardian spirits that protect the hearth."
 hu_religions:0 "Tengri"
 desc_hu_religions:0 "Life on the Great Steppes can be harsh, and the religion of its peoples is focused on the practicalities of everyday life, eschewing metaphysical mysteries for the realities that can be seen and observed; the Sun, Moon, Heaven, and our honorable Ancestors are worthy of veneration."
 baiyue_religions:0 "Baiyue"
 desc_baiyue_religions:0 "The religious teachings of the Baiyue reveal that everything in the world around us, from the mighty streams that flow from the mountains into the marshes to the rocks and stones that comprise the riverbank, has a soul and is worthy of worship, so that the universe might remain in a harmonious state."
 yi_religions:0 "Muisic"
 desc_yi_religions:0 "The religious practices of the Yi are similar to those around them, yet there are distinctive markers that distinguish the tenets of the Yi from those of their neighbors. The veneration of dragons, who alone have the authority to ensure the harvests and protect our villages from illness and misfortune, is supremely important."
 wa_religions:0 "Kodo"
 desc_wa_religions:0 "The spirits worshiped by the Wa are a direct reflection of the violent world they inhabit; ruled by an Animist pantheon of squabbling demons and gods that can only have their thirst quenched by the blood of worthy sacrifices, the Wa remember the ancient ways amd uphold them faithfully."
 ainu_religion:0 "Fuchite"
 desc_ainu_religion:0 "All things are endowed with Kamuy, from the fish in the sea to the man hunting for the fish. All things with Kamuy within their spirits should be respected in death, lest they face the punishment of the Kamuy themselves."

  ##TE RELIGIONS
 christianity:0 "Christian"
 desc_christianity:0 "Christianity is the name given to that definite system of religious belief and practice founded by a Jewish man, Jesus of Nazareth, in the country of Judea, and was promulgated, after its founder's death, for the acceptance of the whole world, by certain chosen men among his followers. These began their mission on the day of Pentecost, around A.D. 30, which day is regarded, accordingly, as the birthday of the Christian Church. Beginning as an obscure sect of Judaism, the chosen leaders among the followers of Jesus, called the Apostles, travelled throughout the world to spread the 'Good News' that their founder, whom they hailed as the prophesied Messiah or Christ ('the anointed one'), is the Son of the only God and had resurrected from the dead to show his power, promising that he would some day return in glory to judge all human souls according to their deeds. The Apostles taught that whoever repents of evil habits and prays to this Jesus for mercy would be saved from eternal death in the underworld and glorified with new life everlasting in a realm of the blessed."
 manichaeism:0 "Manichaean"
 desc_manichaeism:0 "Manichaeism taught an elaborate dualistic cosmology describing the struggle between a good, spiritual world of light, and an evil, material world of darkness. Through an ongoing process that takes place in human history, light is gradually removed from the world of matter and returned to the world of light, whence it came. Its beliefs were based on local Mesopotamian religious movements and Gnosticism."
