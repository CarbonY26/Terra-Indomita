me_chu_1_desc:0 "When [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] received reports on two consecutive days in a row that bandits from [GetProvince('(int32)5588').GetArea.GetName] have been crossing into our border and killing some of the locals, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] rage was all-consuming. Realizing that this situation will only continue to get worse, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has made the difficult decision to fabricate claims on foreign lands. Although some of the Elders doubt the wisdom of this path, there is nothing left to be said on the matter."

me_chu_3_desc:0 "Although it troubles [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to wield arms against fellow believers of the Bon faith, there is a just aspect to the nature of our wars; we only seek to unify our scattered peoples so that the light of our faith might truly bloom. In time, we hope that the sins of our aggression are forgiven...or at least forgotten.\n\nStill, there is something that feels wrong about seeking glory in war against your brothers."

me_chu_5_desc:0 "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], we have outstanding news; although some of our men were afraid to enter the caves, they eventually became used to spelunking and eventually were able to locate the source of gemstones.

me_chu_6_desc:0 "War is always a terrible thing, but it feels worse when it is waged against one's brethren instead of a foreign enemy. There is not much to say besides an expression of regret for the innocent souls that lose their lives in these conflicts; we hope that their journey to Paradise is unimpeded by sins and karmic debt."
me_chu_6.a:0 "We cannnot be personally responsible for everything that happens..."

While many are unhappy that their hands are lifting stones instead of swords, this is all for the better - we are all safer with a solid network of fortifications."

me_chu_8_title:0 "$01_chu_missions_task_8$"
me_chu_8_desc:0 "A new day is upon us, one in which we leave the familiar valleys and mountain roads of our homelands to conquer places that our ancestors never knew.\n\nPerhaps our forebears were not strong enough to fight the foreigners, or maybe they respected some traditions that we have clearly forgotten - for we have no qualms about moving into the Pamir Mountains."

me_chu_9_title:0 "$01_chu_missions_task_9$"
me_chu_9_desc:0 "It has been said that one does not enter the Tarim Basin without a guide, for anyone foolish to do so will find soon find themselves lost in the sandy dunes of the deserts - many an invading army has been swallowed by the shifting sands, never to return home. Thankfully, our silver has been enough to buy the loyalty of some locals, but it would be lying to say that our soldiers are not a little afraid."
me_chu_9.a:0 "This is foolishness - we are going to be fine"

Consultations are brief and the verdict is unanimous, and what is even better is that the omens are favorable - we should continue to push north, for we shall find victory before us."

me_chu_11_desc:0 "While [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has made it known that associating with criminal elements and traitors, regardless of where their loyalties lie, is an unsavoury business, it would also be tremendously foolish to allow such minor qualms to get in the way of achieving what we want. And if anything is true, it is that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is no fool.\n\nOur agents report back that they have met with some informers that will tell us when the city walls are least likely to be manned, and where is the best place to focus our attacks. With any luck, the cities and fortresses will fall quickly."
me_chu_11.a:0 "In the end, we are just trying to save lives"

me_chu_12_title:0 "$01_chu_missions_task_12$"
me_chu_12_desc:0 "While many of our merchants and businessmen were hoping that we would use our finely-honed expertise in city construction, our priorities lie with strengthening our fortresses and fortifications first and foremost.\n\nAll of the delicate things that come with civilization are fine, but we prefer to be safe over soft."
me_chu_12.a:0 "Everyone will thank me for this later, you will see"

me_chu_13_title:0 "$01_chu_missions_task_13$"
me_chu_13_desc:0 "Late in the evening, there was a commotion at the city gates that soon resulted in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] heading down to see what was going on for [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim]self. It was soon apparent why there were shouts of joy and exultation in the streets; our beloved sons that we sent away as riders on an expedition to find the homeland of Tonpa Shenrab have finally returned, ten long years after they left. As the crowds gathered in the square, the details of their story were soon shared with everyone.\n\nThe men rode through the mountains and into the hills of [GetProvince('(int32)6634').GetArea.GetName], staying far away from the watchful eyes of the many scouts and sentries along the roads. It seems that there are many wars being fought in the West, with Generals squabbling over the shattered remnants of Empire, and because of the ongoing conflicts, the tension can be felt even this far East. Still, our riders were able to continue onward without having to shed blood.\n\nAfter many years of encountering strangers that could not understand our tongue, they finally met some tribesmen in the Great Steppes that could speak chu, and it was then that we realized that we had finally found the birthplace of #E Tonpa Shenrab#!. After staying and studying with our distant kinsmen for many years, they finally returned with copies of the sacred texts of our religion that had been long lost to us. This is a life-changing day for our people!"
me_chu_13.a:0 "Tonpa Shenrab has blessed us!"

me_chu_14_title:0 "$01_chu_missions_task_14$"
me_chu_14_desc:0 "Considering how close the South Tarim is to our own borders, it should be an easier foreign conquest than others we have conducted. We are thankful that our supply lines will not be as stretched as they have been - it is the small things that you have to remain thankful for."
me_chu_14.a:0 "Indeed - for who knows what evil tomorrow might bring?"
me_chu_14_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y $01_chu_missions_task_14$#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

me_chu_15_title:0 "$01_chu_missions_task_15$"
me_chu_15_desc:0 "The [GetProvince('(int32)6736').GetArea.GetName] Valley is a distant journey from our capital, and yet we somehow find our interests entwined in this region. Although we anticipate fierce resistance from the inhabitants of the cities that are here, we look forward to adding these centers of civilization and culture to our growing borders."
me_chu_15.a:0 "There is much that we can all learn from each other"

me_chu_16_desc:0 "All throughout our realm, preparations have been made for the celebrations that are to be held in [GetProvince('(int32)5557').GetName], an event that people will undoubtedly be talking about for the next hundred years. Today is a day unlike others in recent memory, for we can finally say that our wars against our brethren have come to an end and an era of peace is upon us.\n\nAs the parades wind their way through the streets of our capital, for a brief moment, the strife and the devastation of the past is forgotten and our people are one."
me_chu_16.a:0 "I promise you that a better future awaits"
me_chu_16_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y $01_chu_missions_task_16$#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

me_chu_17_title:0 "$01_chu_missions_task_17$"
me_chu_17_desc:0 "Thanks to the will demonstrated by [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] (as well as [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] access to the deep pockets of state), we have seen a period of growth in [GetProvince('(int32)5557').GetName] that we hope to see spread throughout the entirety of our country. Let us continue to fund the construction initiatives we have started, and also look for new places that we can build and invest in."
me_chu_17.a:0 "In time, our cities will rival those to be found anywhere in the world"
me_chu_17_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y $01_chu_missions_task_17$#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

me_chu_18_title:0 "$01_chu_missions_task_18$"
me_chu_18_desc:0 "The most incredible thing occurred once we had finished building a holy site in [GetProvince('(int32)5557').GetName], [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. As you are well-aware, our Bon faith believes in animal spirits, and our shamans and holy men often commune with the animals around us.\n\nOne morning, we woke up to find a veritable zoo inside of our temple; it seemed that every type of creature, from rabbits, monkeys, deer, tigers, snakes, falcons and elephants, were all worshiping together at the shrine. I wouldn't believe the story unless I had seen it myself."
me_chu_18.a:0 "I want to go down and see this miracle! What could it mean?"
me_chu_18_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y $01_chu_missions_task_18$#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

me_chu_19_title:0 "$01_chu_missions_task_19$"
me_chu_19_desc:0 "Growing up in the mountains means that you soon become well-acquainted with hunger pangs, for the winters are harsh and a full belly becomes as rare and luxurious as a hot bath. Still, with careful planning, the worst of this can be mitigated, especially if you have a leader as conscientious as [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is.\n\nAlthough spending money on farms is not popular when budgets are tight, everyone certainly enjoys a loaf of freshly-baked bread straight from the oven - a treat that all will get to enjoy more frequently, now that we have expanded our storage capacity by ingeniously building granaries in the mountains themselves. We truly have a visionary leader guiding our nation forward."
me_chu_19.a:0 "Speaking of bread, do we have any on hand? I'm a little hungry"
me_chu_19_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y $01_chu_missions_task_19$#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

me_chu_20_title:0 "$01_chu_missions_task_20$"
me_chu_20_desc:0 "When foreigners first hear that we live primarily in the mountains, they are never sure what to expect - some probably imagine that we must live in caves. Although we laugh when we hear these stories, we extend an invitation to anyone that wishes to visit the so-called 'Mountain Kingdom' for themselves, as some have taken to calling our country.\n\nYou will soon see that we are as civilized as many other countries, and our cities can offer delights to the traveler that will rival anything you will find in the storied capitals of the great kingdoms."
me_chu_20.a:0 "Please, stay awhile with us and take advantage of our hospitality"
me_chu_20_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y $01_chu_missions_task_20$#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

me_chu_21_title:0 "$01_chu_missions_task_21$"
me_chu_21_desc:0 "When [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] first assumed the duties of commanding our people, few could foresee the meteoric rise that would lead [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim] to the absolute pinnacle of power, and yet here we are - maybe even the gods themselves are surprised.\n\nSo much has happened that it would be a fool's errand to recount that many deeds of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], and besides, there will be plenty of poets and bards singing those stories all night long. Before the revelry can begin, however, there is a coronation that we must attend."
me_chu_21.a:0 "I accept this sacred duty and swear to you that I will do my best"
me_chu_21_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y $01_chu_missions_task_21$#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

me_chu_22_title:0 "$01_chu_missions_task_22$"
me_chu_22_desc:0 "It is a beautiful thing when different people can gather together, despite their various backgrounds, and work towards the greater good, whether it's securing the borders of our country militarily or something as mundane as working a communal field together.\n\nRegardless of whether someone is a soldier or a farmer, we want there to be concord among all of our classes, for peace and mutual understanding is the only way that we can move forward."
me_chu_22.a:0 "It is our diversity that gives us our strength; don't you see?"
me_chu_22_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y $01_chu_missions_task_22$#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

me_chu_23_title:0 "$01_chu_missions_task_23$"
me_chu_23_desc:0 "We have no doubt that, in the future on one dark day, the armies of the invader will spill over the horizon and make their way into our homeland. Although we cannot promise that this misfortune will never happen, we can ensure that we are prepared for that moment when it arrives. By building fortresses near every mountain pass that we control on our border, we can at least say that we won't be caught unawares."
me_chu_23.a:0 "We will not give up the mountain passes easily"

me_chu_24_title:0 "$01_chu_missions_task_24$"
me_chu_24_desc:0 "While some cautious voices are arguing that waging wars of conquest is courting disaster, particularly when we consider the might of the Empires that can be found in India, it is their strength that compels us to secure the foothills to the mountains - we want as much warning as possible, with some kind of buffer region between them and us."
me_chu_24.a:0 "We hope that this does not complicate matters politically"

me_chu_25_title:0 "$01_chu_missions_task_25$"
me_chu_25_desc:0 "Although utilizing horses in warfare is still a little strange for our people, who are unable to properly learn how to ride on the steep mountain slopes, we find ourselves in the situation of having some of the best horses in the world available to us, so it's a skill that we should invest the time and resources into mastering. It is true that we can sell horses at market, but there are military benefits to having such deadly beasts in your army."

me_chu_26_title:0 "chu, the Mountain Kingdom"
me_chu_26_desc:0 "Few are those who make the journey into our country, for the roads into the mountains are treacherous and unwelcoming, and because we live far away from the cities of the lowlands, there is much conjecture and speculation about our people.\n\nAs rumors of devastating wars make their way to us, isolated as we are in the far north, it has been decided that the time has come for us to make our formal introductions."
me_chu_26.a:0 "The world will learn everything there is to know about us soon enough..."
me_chu_26_tooltip:0 "Time to make history..."
