 # Cybele Decisions
 become_gallus:0 "Castrate Yourself"
 become_gallus_desc:0 "Due to our ruler's zealous nature, they may castrate themselves as if they were a holy priest of Cybele in order to show reverence for Cybele's consort, Attis."
 make_gallus:0 "Order Priest to Become Gallus"
 make_gallus_desc:0 "The Galli were priests or holy men of the cult of Cybele. Like the goddess' consort Attis, who castrated himself in divine frenzy, a Gallus would too castrate himself and exclusively wear women's clothing. Let us continue this practice by having our high priest castrate himself.\n\nYou can do this once every 25 years."
