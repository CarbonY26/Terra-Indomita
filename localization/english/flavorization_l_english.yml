# RELIGOUS CONVERSIONS
convert_to_puntic_religion:0 "Embrace Waaq"
convert_to_puntic_religion_desc:0 "For years, traders in our ports have spoken of the supreme deity known as the Waaq, who has no other to stand beside him, and the stories of his neverending love and divine authority have resonated with our people, who seek to become his children. Perhaps we could all seek the comforting embrace of Waaq?"
convert_to_chinese_religions:0 "Embrace Chinese Faith"
convert_to_chinese_religions_desc:0 "Like a great light shining at the top of a lofty tower, the Chinese Faith casts long shadows over our people, who have all turned like sunflowers to face the glow coming from strange gods. And yet, are they so strange? Are their ways that different from our own? Are not the similarities greater?"
convert_to_hu_religions:0 "Embrace Hu Faith"
convert_to_hu_religions_desc:0 "The tenets of the Hu Faith have become attractive to our people for multiple reasons; they are envious of the military successes that come to its adherents, believing in the simple directness of Hu faith over our complicated system of ritualized practice. It is possible that they speak truth...perhaps we have lost our way and should worship the winds and the moon."
convert_to_baiyue_religions:0 "Embrace Baiyue Faith"
convert_to_baiyue_religions_desc:0 "The empathetic approach of the Baiyue Faith has won over many converts in our settlements and cities. Claiming that the mindful observance of the sacredness of everything around us provides meaning to their lives, they ask us to join them in this bliss."
convert_to_yi_religions:0 "Embrace Yi Faith"
convert_to_yi_religions_desc:0 "The mysteries of the Yi Faith, which has its roots in lands far from our own, are tantalizing, promising a greater understanding of one's place in the universe after careful study. Considering that many of our people currently practice the Yi Faith, it would be a simple thing to make it official for us all."
convert_to_wa_religions:0 "Embrace Wa Faith"
convert_to_wa_religions_desc:0 "The island of Wa is a land filled with fierce tribes, resistant to foreign diplomatic overtures and savage defenders of their homelands - traits, some say, that come from their faith, which is a source of their power. Perhaps we could embrace their religious ways as our own?"

#NOTE to ZORGO: The 6 reforms are celestial_reform_1, etc....
CELESTIAL_REFORM_1_DESC:0 "The chaos of the Warring States period resulted in a slackening of central authority, allowing heresies to creep in and pollute the religious practices of the people. Rectifying the spiritual mistakes of our citizens is a sacred privilege that the Emperor is entrusted with."
CELESTIAL_REFORM_2_DESC:0 "By establishing an Imperial Examination System, the Emperor can ensure that the highest offices in the land are filled by those that have devoted their lives to understanding the Classics."
CELESTIAL_REFORM_3_DESC:0 "The many dialects and fragmented tongues of our citizens can be an impediment to ruling over such a large empire; by promoting a standard language, communication, and thus the lives of our people, will greatly improve."
CELESTIAL_REFORM_4_DESC:0 "One of our most desired trade goods is silk, that gossamer fabric that barely clings to the body and has become a sign of wealth and prestige among the upper classes. Expanding production of this luxury item will only increase our tax revenues."
CELESTIAL_REFORM_5_DESC:0 "By promoting our efforts at colonization, we are able to grow our sphere of influence in a way that is pleasing to the Emperor, bringing benefits to both the people and the state. Empower our Ministers and the scope of their mission to also include manufacturing claims of war; any lands we desire shall be ours, one way or another."
CELESTIAL_REFORM_6_DESC:0 "By issuing an official currency, the Emperor can not only replace the inferior types of money currently in circulation, such as cowrie shells, but can invigorate the entire economic sector by introducing the only acceptable standard in our markets - a benefit to society."

celestial_reform_1:0 "Standardize Ritual Practices"
celestial_reform_2:0 "Imperial Examination System"
celestial_reform_3:0 "Promote Standard Language"
celestial_reform_4:0 "Silk Tariffs"
celestial_reform_5:0 "Promote Huaxia Colonization"
celestial_reform_6:0 "State Minting"

#NOTE to ZORGO: The 6 merocratic reforms are meritocracy_mod_1, etc....
MERITOCRACY_REFORM_1_DESC:0 "The Zhou were able to rule for as long as they did because of their willingness to entrust power into the hands of a selected bureaucracy; a wise Emperor is surrounded by trusted advisors, with unquestioned loyalty to the Imperial vision."
MERITOCRACY_REFORM_2_DESC:0 "By ordering a thorough review of our naval forces, we can ensure that a system of meritocracy replaces the existing command structure; only the finest soldiers available deserve to become Officers. "
MERITOCRACY_REFORM_3_DESC:0 "Knowing that our network of fortifications is quite literally the backbone of our kingdom, from which our position of strength is predicated upon, the command to bolster our national defenses becomes a moral imperative."
MERITOCRACY_REFORM_4_DESC:0 "The time has come for the Records of our people to be updated, so that we might know the number of households in our kingdom and the tally of our inhabitants. Send out the censors so that all properties might be registered."
MERITOCRACY_REFORM_5_DESC:0 "Among the many prerogatives afforded the Emperor is the ability to administer the weights and measurements used throughout our lands, as well as tightening the flow of imports and exports."
MERITOCRACY_REFORM_6_DESC:0 "The strength of the army is directly proportional to the health of the state; when one suffers, calamity awaits, as the histories show time and time again. A dutiful Emperor will remember the army, taking measures to bolster the officer corps when required."

meritocracy_mod_1:0 "Expand Palace Bureacracy"
meritocracy_mod_2:0 "Promote Naval Officers"
meritocracy_mod_3:0 "Improve Defense Effort"
meritocracy_mod_4:0 "Conduct Population Census"
meritocracy_mod_5:0 "Increase Tariff Control"
meritocracy_mod_6:0 "Boost Officer Corps"

The Mandate of Heaven, once entrusted to the Shang and the Zhou before they were found wanting, has been given to us, and the establishment of a new Dynasty promises to herald in a new era of peace and prosperity.

# Event that fires for the rest of the world (that isn't ai) when someone else becomes chinese emperor
chinese_flavor.4.t:0 "Empire in the East"
chinese_flavor.4.desc:0 "This morning, shortly after dawn, our city guards informed us that a royal embassy had arrived from the Far East, supposedly carrying news that is of great importance to our people. Upon receiving these strangely dressed ambassadors, whose language we found impossible to decipher, we were presented with a sheet of bronze that was covered in peculiar glyphs and symbols. Although none of our wisest could ascertain the meaning of this language, all could appreciate the magnificent craftsmanship of this decree, which was rendered in the finest bronze and decorated with gold leaf. A few moments later, to our great surprise, one of the diplomats began speaking in our native tongue, announcing in formal speech the establishment of a great Empire. After a period of instability and wars, the lands of the East have been gathered together under the authority of an Emperor, who has commanded that every barbarous nation under the sun be informed of their Glorious Ascent. Having made this proclamation, they asked to purchase provisions, for which they paid handsomely, and then the diplomats traveled onward that same evening, leaving us bemused and wondering what it all could mean."
chinese_flavor.4.a:0 "An Empire like this can't last long..."

# Startup event that gives claims on china for all chinese nations
chinese_flavor.5.t:0 "Turmoil in China"
chinese_flavor.5.desc:0 "It is an uncertain time of great turmoil and devastation. Hundreds of years ago, the Zhou Dynasty was forced to abandon its capital, fleeing eastward after a devastating attack by the Quanrong barbarians, and ever since that pivotal moment, the central authority of the Son of Heaven, the Emperor, has been slowly eroded by the ambitions of squabbling warlords, each vying to carve out a kingdom for themselves while nominally acknowledging the weakening Zhou state.\n\nWith each passing day, the pretense of Zhou authority is questioned. Even now, the feeble [GetCharacter('(int32)536').GetName] attempts to broker peace between his vassals, hoping to spare the common people from yet another war, yet the commands of the Emperor are hardly acknowledged outside of the walls of [GetProvince('(int32)8379').GetName], the imperial capital. It is apparent that it is only a matter of time before hostilities resume...the gods of war and death prepare themselves for the feasts to come."
chinese_flavor.5.a:0 "China will be ours!"
chinese_flavor.5.tt:0 "Gain claims on all rival Chinese powers"
